Further results obtained from manual measurements (EGM):
01_EGM_DistributionFlux_PerMeasurement.png:
01_EGM_RelationSoilWaterContent+Flux.png : 
  No correlation between soil water content and CO2-efflux.

Further results obtained from automatic measurements (Licor):
02_Licor_CrossCorrelationFunction_Radiation+Temperature.png:
  For radiation, the correlation coefficient (radiation~soil respiration) is highest for a slightly negative time lag.
  For temperature, the correlation coefficient (temperature~soil respiration) is highest for a positive time lag.
02_Licor_Distribution_DailyAverageFlux.png:
  No significant differences in the daily average CO2-flux between control plots and treatments. 
02_Licor_Distributon_DailyRangeFlux.png:
  The daily range of soil repiration (daily maximum value - daily minimum value) is significantly higher in control plots than in all drought plots.
02_Licor_RelationSoilWaterContent+Flux.png: 
  No correlation between soil water content and CO2-efflux

Further results obtained from comparing manual and automatic measurements as well as soil respiration and ecosystem respiration
03_Comparison_EGM+Licor.png: 
  Distribution of the differences between manually and automatically measured soil CO2 effluxes per plot. 
  CO2-fluxes are compared for the same day and same hour of the day in each case.
03_Comparison_EGM+Licor_PerDay.png:
  Distribution of the differences between manually and automatically measured soil CO2 effluxes per plot and per day. 
  CO2-fluxes are compared for the same hour of the day in each case.
03_Comparison_EcosystemRespiration+SoilRespiration(EGM).png: 
  Distribution of manually measured soil respiration and ecosystem respiration.
